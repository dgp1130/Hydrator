* Context
  * Community protocol
    * Hydration timing doesn't really work
    * No way to await future provided context
    * Should we define global state to represent pending context requests?
  * New implementation
    * Requires everyone to agree on the single implementation.
    * Imperative API means it can be used outside Hydrator.
